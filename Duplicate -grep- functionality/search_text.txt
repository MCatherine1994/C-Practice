If someone loves a flower,
of which just one single blossom grows
in all the millions and millions of stars,
it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars.
He can say to himself,
Somewhere, my flower is thereâ€¦
But if the sheep eats the flower,
in one moment all his stars will be darkened.
All men have the stars, 
but they are not the same things for different people. 
For some, who are travelers, 
the stars are guides. 
For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. 
For others, who are scholars, 
they are problems. 
For my businessman they were wealth.
But all these stars are silent. 
You, you alone, 
will have the stars as no one else has them.
